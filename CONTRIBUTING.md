# Contributing guide

## Note:
1. Always check code version from dev branch before coding.
```
git checkout dev
git pull
```
2. Please consider setting a variable in the .env file and use config.py to load the environment variable.
Sometimes we don't need to update MPXSonar code for all query purposes; if some functions are not related to MPXSonar or some query can easily be implemented, please use DB manager (interface) to communicate to the database instance.

## If you don't install dependencies yet

```
conda create -n mpxsonar-dev python=3.9 poetry fortran-compiler nox pre-commit emboss=6.6.0
conda activate mpxradar-dev
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs  # ignore black reformatting when doing git blame
pre-commit install  # install pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
poetry install  # install current source of covsonar and its dependencies
```

## Before Commit/Push
1. Self-review
    + Check the current branch.
    + Confirm the changes meet the goals 
2. Run python-format checking -> `pre-commit run --all-files`. Fix it if found; otherwise, you will not be allowed to commit and push.

## Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
+ Don't forget to link PR to the issue if you are solving one.

# Add/Update MPXsonar

## First time add MPXsonar
Add MPXsonar repository into this respository like
```
git subtree add --prefix pages/libs/mpxsonar https://github.com/silenus092/mpxsonar dev --squash
```

## Pull new MPXsonar commits
Pull any new updates to the subtree from the remote.
```
git subtree pull --prefix pages/libs/mpxsonar https://github.com/silenus092/mpxsonar dev --squash
```

## Updating/Pushing to the subtree remote repository
If you make a change to anything in subtree the commit will be stored in the MPXRadar-frontend repository and its logs. To update the subtree remote repository with that commit, you must run the same command, excluding --squash and replacing pull for push.
```
git subtree push --prefix pages/libs/mpxsonar https://github.com/silenus092/mpxsonar dev
```

Note: Normally, we don't update the MPXsonar from the MPXRadar-frontend site, but it can happen occasionally. Hence, please consider updating the code from MPXsonar and then using `subtree pull` to update the code.
